# Merry X-Mas everyone! 🎄🎅🎁

This project contains my solutions to the Advent of Code and Advent of TypeScript challenges.
More information here:

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
- [Advent of TypeScript](https://www.adventofts.com/).

## How to run (Advent of Code)

- Clone the repository
- Run `bun install`
- Run `bun start [--year <year>] [--day <day>]` to run a specific challenge of Advent of Code

## How to run (Advent of TypeScript)

Advent of TypeScript works on the "type level" so there isn't really a way to "run" it.
Feel free to checkout the corresponding files in the [`src/advent-of-typescript`](./src/advent-of-typescript/) directory.

### Notes

Some / many previous years / days are missing. Maybe i'll come back to them at a later date. 😄
